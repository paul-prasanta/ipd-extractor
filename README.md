# ipd-extractor
This extractor helps people to extract Contact and SMS information from Blackberry backup (i.e. IPD file) into CSV file. CSV files can be edited using MS Excel and further imported into other mobile platform or export to Web/Cloud. This has been developed in Java, so I'm assuming prior to execute this extractor you have already installed JRE (1.5.x). I hope this library/App will help in both Open Source and Commercial usage!

<b>How to use ?</b> Prior to use, please edit run.bat (Right-click | Open on NotePad?) and mention your IPD file location. At a time it can accept only one IPD file. After successful parsing, it will generate 2 CSV files, one for Contacts and another for SMS.
